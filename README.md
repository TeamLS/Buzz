# Buzz
A quiz game developed in Java, with categories, music, graphics, multiplayer and two languages (Greek and English).
The graphics are from the popular game [Buzz!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzz!).
The game consists of 6 rounds and each round is randomly chosen to be one of the round modes described below. There
are simple text questions and questions with images. You can play solo or with 2 players. The scores are stored and there is a ranking
for the single-player games (counting points) and for multi-player games (counting wins).

The current project was developed for educational purposes and there was an attempt to use the best practices
and we tried to make the code easily expandable (e.g. you can add more players with little changes) and readable (including comments
and Javadoc).
